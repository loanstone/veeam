cmd service that syncs 2 folders
sync must be one-way -> original folder must not be touched
arguments: sync period, source and destination folders, logfile path
when the sync runs, only sync changes. do not sync the whole folder again and again.

sync all actions that may occur inside the folder: creation, deletion, copying, removal, renaming (name+subdirectory change)
log everything to the provided logfile -> each row should contain timestamp, action, target
if a subdir is affected, only log create / delete / rename. do not log changes to the contents. only log changes to the end files.
what will happen if the source and destination folders are renamed when the service is running?

write tests for all of the above

if 1 origin and 0 backup file, create a backup file, log as "Create"
if 1 origin and 1 backup files have the same md5 and are in the same directory, do nothing
if 1 origin and 1 backup files have the same md5 and are in different directories, change the directory of the backup file (create if necessary), log as "Move"
if 1 origin and 1 backup files have the same md5 and are in the same directory but have different names, rename the backup file, log as "Rename"
if 2 or more origin and 1 or more backup files have the same md5, create the backup files, log as "Copy"
if backup file(s) has a different name than original, rename the backup, log as "Rename"
if 0 origin and 1 or more backup files, delete the backup, log as "Delete"
