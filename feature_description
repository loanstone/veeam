cmd service that syncs 2 folders
sync must be one-way -> original folder must not be touched
arguments: sync period, source and destination folders, logfile path
when the sync runs, only sync changes. do not sync the whole folder again and again.

sync all actions that may occur inside the folder: creation, deletion, copying, removal, renaming (name+subdirectory change)
log everything to the provided logfile -> each row should contain timestamp, action, target
if a subdir is affected, only log create / delete / rename. do not log changes to the contents. only log changes to the end files.
what will happen if the source and destination folders are renamed when the service is running?

write tests for all of the above
